__Metaverse__ is coming. Metaverse is a technological megatrend that aims to build an immersive virtual world facilitated by augmented and virtual reality along with internet technology. Metaverse can be realized through the  __multi-model multi-tasks (MMMT)__, combining various models such as object detection, face recognition and pose estimation as basic functionality, to provide complex applications. 

## [JNPU (ESSCIRC'23)]()
JNPU introduces a speculative cyclic quantization that enables integer-based operations with minimal floating-point arithmetic, reducing external memory access of switching multi nerual networks. It involves a novel processing cluster with four BIG-INT8 arrays and a little-FP16 vector processor that can provide heterogeneity in microarchitecture, data precision, and dataflow, resulting in 56.3% area and 26.9% power savings compared to floating-point-only array processors. Fabricated in a 28-nm process, the JNPU chip is successfully demonstrated with popular DNN models such as MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, VGG16, and PoseNet.
