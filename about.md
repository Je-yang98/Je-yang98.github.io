I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Columbia Univerisity and working with System-Level Design (SLD) Group. My research interests include heterogeneous reconfigurable architecture/accelerators and hardware/software co-design approach for deep learning workloads.

Before joining SLD group, I received M.S. degree and B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I also worked at AI Accelerator and System Team in Rebellions Inc., as a reserach intern.
