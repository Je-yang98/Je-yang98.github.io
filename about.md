---
I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Columbia Univerisity and working with [System-Level Design (SLD) Group](https://sld.cs.columbia.edu/). My research interests include heterogeneous reconfigurable architecture/accelerators and hardware/software co-design approach for deep learning workloads.

Before joining SLD group, I received M.S. degree and B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I was a graduate research assistant in [Circuits-Architecture-Systems-Technology Group](https://castlab.kaist.ac.kr/) and after that I also worked at AI Accelerator and System Team in [Rebellions Inc.](https://rebellions.ai/?ckattempt=1) as a reserach intern.
